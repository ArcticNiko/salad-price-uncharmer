# What is Salad Price Uncharmer?
**Salad Price Uncharmer** is a userscript that rounds the prices of rewards up on the Salad store. It allows users to counteract "charm pricing," a highly effective pricing strategy that sets prices just below a round number (ex. $0.99 instead of $1) to make them appear more affordable.

## What are the benefits of Salad Price Uncharmer?
* It represents prices more honestly
* It gives a more accurate image of a reward's value
* It reduces the risk of impulse buying
* It allows people to make smarter purchasing decisions

## It only rounds up reward prices
It won't round up your earnings, nor will it round up your balance. It also won't round up the prices at the order summary. This userscript prefers to keep those untouched for accuracy.
